                            <p class="mb-0">Prof. Serrani's research interests lie in the field of control and systems theory, 
                                with emphasis on nonlinear control, tracking and regulation, nonlinear dynamical systems, and 
                                application to aerospace and marine systems. He is currently involved in research projects on modeling, 
                                guidance and control of air-breathing hypersonic vehicle, flight control systems design for flapping-wing 
                                micro air vehicles, aerodynamic flow control, and automotive systems, supported by NASA, AFRL and Ford. 
                                He is the co-author (with A. Isidori and L. Marconi) of the book Robust Autonomous Guidance: An Internal 
                                Model-Based Approach, published by Springer-Verlag, and the author or co-author of more than 100 journal 
                                and conference papers, and chapters in edited books.

                                Prof. Serrani is a Fulbright Fellow, the recipient of a 2007 Lumley Research Award and the co-recipient 
                                (with Prof. Mo Samimy) of the 2008 Lumley Interdisciplinary Research Award, both from the College of 
                                Engineering at OSU. He is a member of IEEE, AIAA and IFAC. He is a past Associate Editor for Automatica, 
                                the IEEE Transactions on Control Systems Technology, The International Journal of Robust and Nonlinear Control, 
                                and serves in the IEEE Conference Editorial Board as Associate Editor for invited and regular papers in Nonlinear,

                                <!-- I received my B.S. degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Bogazici University, Istanbul in 2004, 
                                my M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from the Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA in 2006 and my Ph.D 
                                degree again in Electrical Engineering from Northeastern University, Boston, MA in 2010. Between 2010 and 2013, I was a 
                                Control and Dynamical Systems postdoctoral scholar at the Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences at California 
                                Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA. I joined the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department at the University 
                                of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, in Fall 2013, where I am currently the Chen-Luan Family Faculty Development Professor of ECE and 
                                an associate professor of EECS and Robotics. I am part of the Michigan Controls Group and also affiliated with the Michigan Institute 
                                for Data Science (MIDAS) and Michigan Institute for Computational Discovery & Engineering (MICDE). -->

                                Prof. Ozay's research interests include dynamical systems, control, optimization and formal methods with applications in cyber-physical systems, 
                                system identification, verification and validation, and autonomy. Her papers received several awards including a best paper award from the Journal of Nonlinear Analysis: 
                                Hybrid Systems for the years 2014-2016. She received a DARPA Young Faculty Award in 2014, an NSF CAREER Award, a NASA Early Career Faculty 
                                Award and a DARPA Directorâ€™s Fellowship in 2016, an ONR Young Investigator Award and the 1938E Award from the University of Michigan College 
                                of Engineering in 2018, and a 2019 Henry Russel Award from the University of Michigan, Rackham Graduate School. She was selected as an 
                                Outstanding Reviewer of the IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control in 2011. She is also the recipient of the 2021 Antonio Ruberti Young 
                                Researcher Prize from the IEEE Control Systems Society for my fundamental contributions to the control and identification of hybrid and 
                                cyber-physical systems. She was a co-chair of the 22nd ACM Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control in 2019 and program 
                                co-chair for the IFAC Conference on Analysis and Design of Hybrid Systems (ADHS) in 2021. She is currently an associate editor for the Journal 
                                of Discrete Event Dynamic Systems, Nonlinear Analysis: Hybrid Systems, and Automatica. She is a member of the IEEE and ACM.
