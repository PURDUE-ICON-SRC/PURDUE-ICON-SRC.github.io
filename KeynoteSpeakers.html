                        Federated learning enables machine learning algorithms to be trained over decentralized edge devices without requiring the exchange of local datasets. We consider two scenarios in this talk. In the first scenario, we have cooperative agents running distributed optimization methods. Current literature fail to capture the heterogeneity in agents’ local computation capacities. We propose FedHybrid as a hybrid primal-dual method that allows heterogeneous agents to perform a mixture of first and second order updates.  We prove that FedHybrid converges linearly to the exact optimal point for strongly convex functions. In the second scenario, we consider strategic agents with different data distributions. We analyze how the distribution of data affects agents' incentives to voluntarily participate and obediently follow traditional federated learning algorithms. We design a Faithful Federated Learning (FFL) mechanism based on FedAvg method and VCG mechanism which achieves (probably approximate) optimality, faithful implementation, voluntary participation, and balanced budget. Lastly, we analyze an alternative approach to align individual agent’s incentive to participate by allowing them to opt in or out. We propose a game theoretic framework and study the equilibrium properties with both rational and bounded rational agents.

                    <h4>Title: Control, optimization, and network analysis and application to two metal processing technologies</h4>
                    <p>
                        The primary metal processing technologies that have enabled our modern era of infrastructure, transportation, healthcare, and consumer products have been largely unchanged for decades.  This presentation will highlight two emerging changes to metal processing that are firmly rooted in robotics – metal additive manufacturing and hybrid autonomous manufacturing – and how controls, optimization, and network analysis can transform the current heuristic, open-loop approach to one with feedback-controlled regulation of part quality.  The key objectives of the talk are to communicate the primary challenges in metal processing with respect to control, optimization, and network analysis and the implications for control system design.  Two preliminary results in estimator and control application to the processes will elucidate potential improvements enabled by feedback control application and some unsolved problems. The talk will conclude with a projection on the future of metal processing and key challenges that will require expertise from the control, optimization, and networks community.
