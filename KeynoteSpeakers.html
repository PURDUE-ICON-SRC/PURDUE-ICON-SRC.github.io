                    <h4>Title: Dynamic Control Allocation: from Theory to Applications through Geometric and Adaptive Control</h4>
                    <p>
                        We present an approach to the systematic design of dynamic control allocation schemes for general classes 
                        of input-redundant systems that results in plug-in modules for existing or desired control architectures. 
                        The enabling methodology is a geometric characterization of over-actuated systems that leads to the 
                        exploitation of input redundancy in the system inverse, rather than in the plant model itself. In the 
                        proposed approach, the steady-state behavior of the system is shaped through adaptation of free parameters 
                        stemming from dynamic optimization of selected performance criteria penalizing both the control input and 
                        the state trajectory, all while maintaining invariance of the error-zeroing manifold. The method is applied 
                        to fault-tolerant control of over-actuated aircraft, where results from flight tests on a scaled model are 
                        presented alongside simulation studies.

                    <h4>Title: Control, optimization, and network analysis and application to two metal processing technologies</h4>
                    <p>
                        The primary metal processing technologies that have enabled our modern era of infrastructure, transportation, healthcare, and consumer products have been largely unchanged for decades.  This presentation will highlight two emerging changes to metal processing that are firmly rooted in robotics – metal additive manufacturing and hybrid autonomous manufacturing – and how controls, optimization, and network analysis can transform the current heuristic, open-loop approach to one with feedback-controlled regulation of part quality.  The key objectives of the talk are to communicate the primary challenges in metal processing with respect to control, optimization, and network analysis and the implications for control system design.  Two preliminary results in estimator and control application to the processes will elucidate potential improvements enabled by feedback control application and some unsolved problems. The talk will conclude with a projection on the future of metal processing and key challenges that will require expertise from the control, optimization, and networks community.
