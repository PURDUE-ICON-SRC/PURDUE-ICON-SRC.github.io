                                The safe control of multi-robot swarms is a challenging and active field of research, 
                                where common goals include maintaining group cohesion while simultaneously avoiding 
                                obstacles and inter-agent collision. Building off our previously developed theory for 
                                distributed collaborative safety-critical control for networked dynamic systems, we 
                                propose a distributed algorithm for the formation control of robot swarms given individual 
                                agent dynamics, induced formation dynamics, and local neighborhood position and 
                                velocity information within a defined sensing radius for each agent. Individual safety 
                                guarantees for each agent are obtained using rounds of communication between neighbors 
                                to restrict unsafe control actions among cooperating agents through safety conditions 
                                derived from high-order control barrier functions (CBFs). One application of this algorithm is 
                                to the control of drone swarms in forest fire surveillance where drones are to automatically 
                                maximize sensor coverage of a designated area while simultaneously avoiding no-fly areas.

                            <p>
                                Layered architectures have been widely used in robot systems, where planning and execution 
                                functions often operate in separate layers. Despite their widespread use, there still lacks 
                                a straightforward way to transit from high-level tasks in the planning layer to low-level 
                                motor commands in the execution layer. To address this gap, we introduce a novel approach 
                                that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to ground the robot primitive tasks to low-level 
                                actions. Our focus is on manipulator interaction control tasks. We designed a program-function-like 
                                prompt based on the task frame formalism. In this way, we enable LLMs to generate position/force 
                                set-points for hybrid control.

                            <p>
                                Hybrid thermal management systems (hybrid TMS) in their most basic form consist of a component 
                                that generates heat, and a device that expels that heat. A thermal energy storage device (TES) 
                                can be added to improve system performance. In addition, model predictive control (MPC) has been 
                                shown to be effective and robust in the optimal control of many systems, including TMS. While many 
                                have proposed controllers for hybrid TMS, many approximations are usually made to ensure computational 
                                feasibility. We propose a single step controller (as opposed to a hierarchical approach) that enforces 
                                the TES nonlinear phase change dynamics. In addition, our prediction model is a high state system, 
                                containing 77 states. After synthesizing the controller, we also show experimental results of the MPC 
                                implemented on a testbench.

                            <p>
                                This work presents a data-driven approach to approximate the dynamics of a nonlinear time-varying system 
                                (NTVS) by a linear time-varying system (LTVS), which results from the Koopman operator and deep neural 
                                networks. Analysis of the approximation error between states of the NTVS and the resulting LTVS is presented. 
                                Simulations on a representative NTVS show that the proposed method achieves small approximation errors, 
                                even when the system changes rapidly. Furthermore, simulations in an example of quadcopters demonstrate the 
                                computational efficiency of the proposed approach.

                            <p>
                                The ability to complete additional tasks without redesigning the optimal control system from the beginning 
                                provides significant flexibility in real-life applications. To facilitate this adaptability feature, tunable 
                                parameters are often included in the dynamical model and/or objective function of the system. While an 
                                approach known as Pontryagin Differentiable Programming (PDP) has been proven effective for tuning single 
                                and multi-agent optimal control systems, previous studies have overlooked safety challenges such as inter-agent 
                                constraints inherent in multi-agent systems. Inspired by PDP, this study proposes an adaptive distributed framework 
                                for multi-agent safety-critical optimal systems where a network of agents cooperatively optimizes tunable parameters 
                                to minimize the sum of their loss functions while ensuring safety. The main idea of the proposed framework relies on 
                                integrating barrier function and gradient descent-based distributed optimization with a gradient generator that 
                                captures the optimal performance as a function of the parameter in the feedback loop tuning the parameter for each 
                                agent. Theoretical and simulation results are obtained to verify this proposed adaptive distributed framework for 
                                safety-critical multi-agent optimal control systems.

                            <p>
                                The use of barrier functions to provide provably safe collision guarantees in the field of optimal control is a 
                                recent advancement. Taking advantage of the properties of set invariance provided by barrier function formulations, 
                                control barrier functions (CBF) can be utilized as safety filters to ensure safety-critical control. Additionally, 
                                when formulated as quadratic programs, CBFs provide faster real-time implementation, more flexibility, and improved 
                                constraint handling over typical optimal control methods.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Stochastic CBFs arise from the need to guarantee performance of CBFs even in stochastic environments, where Gaussian 
                                noise can cause the system to take unsafe actions. We investigate the application of Stochastic CBF methodology into 
                                collision-cone based barrier functions, and discuss future directions of theoretical research in the field.

                            <p>
                                This study introduces a method to obtain a neighboring extremal optimal control (NEOC) solution for a broad class of 
                                nonlinear systems with non-quadratic performance indices by investigating the variation to a known closed-loop optimal 
                                control law caused by small, known variations in the system parameters or in the performance index. The NEOC solution can 
                                formally be obtained by solving a linear partial differential equation similar to those arising in an iterative solution 
                                procedure for a nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Motivated by numerical procedures for solving such an equation, we also 
                                propose a numerical algorithm based on the Galerkin algorithm that uses basis functions to solve the underlying Hamilton-Jacobi 
                                equation. This approach allows the determination of the minimum performance index as a function of both the system state and 
                                parameters and extends to allow the determination of the adjustment to an optimal control law given a small adjustment of 
                                parameters in the system or the performance index, effectively by computing the derivative of the law with respect to those 
                                parameters. The validity of the claims and theory is supported by numerical simulations.

                            <p>
                                My work focuses on a pursuit-evasion differential game involving two slow pursuers and a fast evader, considering capture radius. 
                                The Cartesian Oval (CO) is implemented to represent game parameters accurately. Depending on the gap type, pursuers have a capture 
                                guarantee or both pursuers and evader have their own optimal strategy from nash equailibrum. Sub-obtimal strategies for both pursuer 
                                side and evader side are proposed as well, which will significantly reduce the computational cost of finding the nash equilibrium 
                                point of the game for optimal strategies. The study concludes that improved cooperation using reachable region analysis enhances 
                                capture success, challenging the optimality of prior strategies.

                            <p>
                                Consider an unknown nonlinear dynamical system that is known to be dissipative. The objective of this paper is to learn a neural 
                                dynamical model that approximates this system, while preserving the  dissipativity property in the model. In general, imposing 
                                dissipativity constraints during neural network training is a hard problem for which no known techniques exist. In this work, 
                                we address the problem of learning a dissipative neural dynamical system model in two stages. First, we learn an unconstrained 
                                neural dynamical model that closely approximates the system dynamics. Next, we derive sufficient conditions to perturb the weights 
                                of the neural dynamical model to ensure dissipativity, followed by perturbation of the biases to retain the fit of the model to the 
                                trajectories of the nonlinear system. We show that these two perturbation problems can be solved independently to obtain a  neural 
                                dynamical model that is guaranteed to be dissipative while closely approximating the nonlinear system.

                                Langevin diffusion processes refer to a class of stochastic processes driven by Brownian motion. They have been widely used in various 
                                sampling tasks in machine learning. I will discuss with Langevin diffusion, gradient Langevin algorithms, and how this powerful tool 
                                can be used in the analysis and implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms (Thompson sampling). In particular, I will go over 
                                two topics: sampling from gradient Langevin diffusion with Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and its application in multi-armed bandits. More
